A time series is a sequence of observations collected at a constant time intervals.\n","2.   The sequence of observations are made at a constant frequency, accordingly, they are termed as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual series. Although there are some time series wherein data is collected at a frequency of minutes and seconds, there are not considedred here.\n","\n","***How is time series analysis different from regression analysis?***\n","\n","1.   A time series analysis is time dependent (autocorrelation), which violates the primary assumption of a linear regression models that the observations are independent of each other.\n","2.   Additionally, a time series may have an increasing or decreasing trend, cyclic pattern, and seasonal pattern. For example, sale of jumpers is higher in winter months compred to the other months of a year.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yOp_gxQrOtRa"},"source":["# **What is time series forecasting?**\n","1. Forecasting involves predicting the future as accurately as possible, given all of the information available, including historical data and knowledge of any future events that might impact the forecast. For example, forecasting future electricity demand, forcasting future stock price, forecasting future sales, etc.\n","2. Some things are easier to forecast than others. For example, it is easier to predict the time of the sunrise tomorrow morning, whereas, tomorrow’s lotto numbers cannot be forecast with any accuracy.\n","3. Time series forecasting has tremendous commercial value because parameters that effect a business like demand and sales, number of visitors to a website, etc are eminable to forecasting.\n","\n","***What is the difference between time series analysis and time series forecasting?***\n","\n","1. Time series analysis is the preparatory step before you forecast into the future.\n","2. It involves understanding various aspects about the inherent nature of the series so that you are better informed to create meaningful and accurate forecasts into the future.\n","\n","***What factors influence future predictability?***\n","\n","The predictability of a quantity depends on several factors including:\n",">1. how well we understand the factors that contribute to it;\n","2. how much data is available;\n","3. whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast.\n","\n","*Examples:*\n",">1. Electricity deand can be accurately forecast as it satisfies all three requirements.\n","2. Forecasting stock pricess is very difficult as we do not understand all the factors affecting a stock's price."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a1PD1RqCPBOF"},"source":["# **Loading time series data into Pandas**\n","\n","Time series data is typicall stored in a *csv* or *Excell* file.
